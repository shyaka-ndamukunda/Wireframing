# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic layout or blueprint of a user interface (UI) before the actual design and development take place. It focuses on structure, content placement, and functionality without distractions like colors or images.

## Why Is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing helps:
- Clarify ideas early in the design process.
- Facilitate collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- Identify potential usability issues before they become expensive to fix.
- Save time and resources by refining layout and structure early.
- Provide a roadmap for visual design and development teams.
