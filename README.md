# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic layout or blueprint of a user interface (UI) before the actual design and development take place. It focuses on structure, content placement, and functionality without distractions like colors or images.

## Why Is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing helps:
- Clarify ideas early in the design process.
- Facilitate collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- Identify potential usability issues before they become expensive to fix.
- Save time and resources by refining layout and structure early.
- Provide a roadmap for visual design and development teams.
  
## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes consist of several important elements that define the structure and functionality of a user interface. Here are the key components:

### 1. Layout Structure
Defines how different components are arranged on the screen. It outlines the basic skeleton and helps organize content effectively.

**Example:** A homepage layout with a header at the top, a sidebar for navigation, and content in the center.

### 2. Navigation
Shows how users move between different pages or sections of the app or website. Good navigation ensures smooth user flow.

**Example:** A top menu bar with links to Home, Services, About, and Contact.

### 3. Content Placement
Indicates where text, images, buttons, and other media are positioned. This helps prioritize important content and improves readability.

**Example:** Placing a call-to-action (CTA) button just below the product description.

### 4. Functionality
Outlines the interactive elements users can engage with, such as buttons, input fields, sliders, or dropdowns.

**Example:** A login form with email and password fields, a "Remember Me" checkbox, and a login button.
